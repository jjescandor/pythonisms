#### Project: Pythonisms
#### Author: JJ Escandor

- Create examples demonstrating pythonic language features. For example…
    - Use iterators/generators on a custom collection to…
        - add ability to be used in a for in loop
        - add ability to be used in a list comprehension
        - add ability to convert to a list or other collection type
- Create a decorator that adds behavior to a given function. For example…
    - Calculate the time spent in the function
    - Log relevant info for debugging purposes
    - Slow down the function
    - Convert the return value in some way
    - Validate some condition on the way in
- Use dunder methods make your code more readable and elegant. For example…
    - add ability for two custom data structure to be considered equal
    - add ability for custom data structure to be considered truthy/falsy

## Findings

- Decorators are super cool
- not a fan of making linked list act like a list. it's not super efficient.
